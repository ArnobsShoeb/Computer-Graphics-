Game Name: Maze Quest 3D: Survival Challenge



1. Player Movement

The player can navigate the maze freely using W/S keys for forward/backward movement and A/D keys to rotate. Movement is smooth and responsive, allowing precise navigation through corridors and around obstacles.

2. Jumping & Navigation

The player can jump to reach elevated spots, cross small gaps, or avoid hazards strategically, adding a vertical dimension to exploration.

3. Camera System

Third-person perspective using gluLookAt ensures full visibility of the player and surrounding maze.

Adjustable FOV (gluPerspective) for zoom in/out.

Camera movement with arrow keys and a toggle (Right Mouse Button) for first-person view.

4. Grid Floor Arena

The maze floor is rendered as a grid of quads, giving visual cues for navigation. The floor can change colors dynamically, adding a sense of progression and atmosphere.

5. Obstacles & Decorations

Maze features 3D objects like cubes, cylinders, and spheres, which act as walls, barriers, or decoration, enhancing the visual depth and challenge.

6. Goal Zone

A pulsing red quad area marks the level’s goal. Players must reach this zone to complete a level. It’s visually distinct and draws player attention.

7. Collectibles & Power-Ups

Randomly placed coins and power-ups appear as spheres or points. Collecting them increases score, restores health, or grants temporary buffs.

8. HUD & Text Overlay

A Heads-Up Display shows Lives, Score, and Level, ensuring the player always knows their current status. Text is rendered clearly on top of the 3D scene.

9. Bullet Firing

Player can fire projectiles (spheres) using the Left Mouse Button. Bullets interact with hazards or enemies, adding combat mechanics.

10. Cheat Mode

Pressing C key toggles cheat/debug mode, allowing testing of levels, revealing hidden paths, or skipping sections.

11. Reset & Restart

Pressing R key restarts the game from Level 1, giving players the ability to retry after failure.

12. Lives & Health System

The player has a finite number of lives. Collisions, falling hazards, or enemy hits reduce health or life count. Game Over occurs when lives reach zero.

13. Static Walls

Walls act as barriers within the maze. Colliding with them may reduce health or block progress, enforcing careful navigation.

14. Falling Hazards

Certain floor tiles disappear or create holes in later levels, forcing players to plan movements carefully and avoid falling.

15. Moving Hazards

Some obstacles like cubes or cylinders move along predefined paths. Contact with them reduces health, adding dynamic challenge to levels.

16. Level Progression

The game has 3 levels, each with increasing difficulty. Completing the goal zone advances to the next level. Game Over and Victory messages are displayed appropriately.

17. Dynamic Colors & Animations

Floors, hazards, and collectibles change color over time or pulse, enhancing visual feedback and immersion. Animations are handled in the idle() function.

18. Player–Hazard Interaction

Player actions and environmental hazards interact seamlessly. For example, bullets can destroy some hazards, while jumping avoids others.

19. Camera & Player Synergy

Camera adjusts smoothly based on player position and actions, ensuring the view always aligns with gameplay. First-person toggle allows a more immersive experience.

20. HUD Feedback & Game State

All game events — health loss, collectibles, level completion — are reflected in the HUD and visual cues, keeping the player informed in real time.
